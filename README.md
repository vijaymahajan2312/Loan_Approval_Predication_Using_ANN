# Loan_Approval_Predication_Using_ANN

Loan prediction is a very common real-life problem that every retail bank faces in their lending operations. If the loan approval process is automated, it can save a lot of man hours and improve the speed of service to the customers. The increase in customer satisfaction and savings in operational costs are significant. However, the benefits can only be reaped if the bank has a robust model to accurately predict which customer's loan it should approve and which to reject, in order to minimize the risk of loan default.

Loan Approval prediction is classic problem to learn and apply lots of data analysis techniques to create best Artificial Neural Network model. Given with the data set consisting of details of applicants loan and status whether the loan application is approved or not. On the basis of Artificial Neural Network model is to create with good accuracy.
